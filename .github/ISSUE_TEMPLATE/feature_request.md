This issue needs a [Quest](https://medium.com/@trek/source-quest-ff7d227d8fed).

The goal is to give the developer who implements this feature the proper context and
starting point so as to make it easy for anyone to get started quickly, regardless of background,
domain expertise, or familiarity with a particular part of the code.
<!-- delete after writing quest -->

## Motivation
<!--
Why is this change needed? Who will benefit from it?

This is a good place to link to the designs, if appropriate.
-->

## Plan of action
<!--
If this is a meta-feature composed of several smaller features, those smaller
features should be listed as a checklist here, and then issues should be made
for those sub-features and referenced here.

If it is a single feature, and it has multiple required steps that you already
know will be required, list them here to give whoever picks up the issue a head start.
-->

## Scope
<!--
Optional; only needed if it's not clear from the Plan of action above.

How do you know when you're done? This should clearly define the conditions
that *must* be true before this issue can be closed. Being explicit about this
helps clearly define the scope of work and avoid scope creep.
This is also a good place to list things that are expliltly NOT included.

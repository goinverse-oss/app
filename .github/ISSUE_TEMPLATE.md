<!--- Make sure the title above succinctly describes the issue, and then -->

<!--- Planning a new feature or change? Please fill out this template: -->

This is largely modeled after the idea of [Quests](https://medium.com/@trek/source-quest-ff7d227d8fed).
The goal is to give the developer who implements this feature the proper context and
starting point so as to make it easy for anyone to get started quickly, regardless of background,
domain expertise, or familiarity with a particular part of the code.

## Motivation
<!--- Why is this change needed? Who will benefit from it? -->
<!--- It's often helpful (but not required) to phrase the answer thusly: -->
<!--- "As a <stakeholder>, I want to <action> so that I can <purpose achieved by action>." -->
<!--- e.g. "As a patron, I want to log in via Patreon so that I can access the -->
<!--- meditations without creating a separate account just for this app." -->

## Plan of action
<!--- If this is a meta-feature composed of several smaller features, -->
<!--- those smaller features should be listed as a checklist here, -->
<!--- and then issues should be made for those sub-features and referenced here. -->
<!--- If it is a single feature, and it has multiple required steps that you -->
<!--- already know will be required, list them here to give whoever picks up -->
<!--- the issue a head start. -->

## Scope
<!--- Optional; only needed if it's not clear from the Plan of action above.-->
<!--- How do you know when you're done? This should clearly define the conditions -->
<!--- that *must* be true before this issue can be closed. Being explicit about this -->
<!--- helps clearly define the scope of work and avoid scope creep. -->
<!--- This is also a good place to list things that are expliltly NOT included. -->
